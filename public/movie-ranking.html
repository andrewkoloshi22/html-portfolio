<h1>Andrew's Top 3 Movies of All Time</h1>
<h2>These are the best movies according to Andrew</h2>
<hr />


<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>Not just a super-hero movie but a crime drama about a group of people who step up to clean their city. Three people who work together as a symbol of hope. Nobody has ever played a better villain than Heath Ledger in this film.</p>

<h3>Django Unchained</h3>
<p>A film about the troubles of slavery with a somewhat lightheardted tone. Christoph Waltz's performance as the slave-freeing bounty hunter is mezmorizing and is a real bright spot on this look into a sour history.</p>

<h3>Planes, Trains & Automobiles</h3>
<p>Thanksgiving being my favorite holiday, it's only fitting this would be in here. As a lover of all things John Candy and any buddy road trip movies, this movie is has everything i could ever want. Great laughs, great heart and two great comedians who play off of eachother perfectly.</p>
